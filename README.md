This is an official PyTorch implementation of paper [AMSP-UOD: When Vortex Convolution and Stochastic Perturbation Meet Underwater Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11918)

## Quick Start

This code repository includes the base run code for AMSP-UOD, see folder `./weights` for the weights file, and see folder `./result` for the PR curve graph. There is some of the urpc test data in folder `./urpc`, and you can get the recognition results using `./det.sh`

### 1. Deploy Conda environment
```Command Line
conda create -n AMSP_UOD python==3.10
```

### 2. Install package dependencies
```Command Line
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train Model (Optional, requires Datasets and Cuda)
Our default code uses NMS-Similar algorithm from the paper, and you should either turn off val validation or post-process that use the traditional NMS algorithm before training.
This is done by switching the file `./utils/general.py` from lines 950 to 953.
```Command Line
conda activate AMSP_UOD
./train.sh 0
```

### 4. Test Model (Optional, requires Datasets and Cuda)
Note that when testing model performance, change the val option in urpc.yaml from self-divided data to urpc's B-list data.
```Command Line
conda activate AMSP_UOD
./val.sh
```

### 5. Dectet
```Command Line
conda activate AMSP_UOD
./det.sh
```
